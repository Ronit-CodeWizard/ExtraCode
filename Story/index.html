                    <p>The morning began just like any other—quiet, slow, and painfully ordinary. I dragged myself through my routine, brushing, dressing, and packing for school with little excitement. It was only my third day at this new school, and everything still felt strange and unfamiliar.</p>

                    <p>I waited at the bus stand, yawning and half-awake, while the morning breeze carried the faint sound of birds and chatter around Narwapahar. When the bus arrived, I climbed in, found a seat, and sat in silence. My elbow rested on my knee, chin on my palm, eyes wandering out the window as the familiar roads rolled past. The scenery outside blurred into greens and browns, and boredom hung heavy on me.</p>

                    <p>When the bus finally stopped at Jadugoda, I stayed seated for a moment, still lost in thought. That's when I saw her—walking down the road toward the school gate, smiling brightly as she chatted with her friend. For a second, everything around me froze. The noise faded, the bus engine quieted, and all I could see was that smile. I didn't even know her name, yet something inside me shifted.</p>

                    <p>Later, as I entered the classroom, my heart skipped a beat. She was there—in my section. That single coincidence felt like fate itself. Trying to shake off the excitement, I greeted some new faces and soon became friends with Shiv, Rohan, Gopal, and Prakash. Prakash was from Jadugoda, and the rest were from Turamdih—each with their own stories, their own laughter.</p>

                    <p>By the sixth period, we had our library class. Curiosity got the better of me, so I asked Rohan who that girl was. He grinned and said, "Her name's Tanisha Singh. She's from Turamdih." Just hearing her name felt like unlocking a secret.</p>

                    <p>That evening, I asked Rohan for her Instagram handle. Her account was private, so I sent a follow request and waited. When she accepted—and even followed me back—I was stunned. She didn't even know my name, and yet somehow, our paths had quietly crossed again.</p>

                    <p>The next morning, I told Rohan about it, grinning ear to ear. That's how it all began. To start a conversation, I messaged her asking for the chemistry notes from class. She replied kindly, and from there, our chats grew little by little. I found myself trying to keep her attention, drawing her closer with every message.</p>

                    <p>At school, rules kept us from talking freely, but her benchmate, Angel Roshni—the girls' monitor—knew about us. Funny enough, Rohan was the boys' monitor, and I was the Biology Lab Vice-Captain. Somehow, fate had placed all the right people around me to keep this secret alive.</p>

                    <p>Days passed, and everything felt perfect… until whispers began spreading. A classmate, Dasmat, mentioned my name, then Chaitan, then Debashish—until the whole bus seemed to know I liked her. Everyone's sudden curiosity turned her attention away from me. Soon after, I heard she had started talking to another boy—a poetry lover. That burned inside me. I stopped talking to her completely.</p>

                    <p>Later, I discovered that the boy wasn't even writing his own poems; he was copying someone else's lines. Somehow, that made it worse and funnier at the same time. I tried to move on, but when I learned that she'd stopped talking to him too, my heart betrayed me again. I began speaking to her once more.</p>

                    <p>One day, during Raksha Bandhan, I got a message from her that simply said, "Hey." For a second, I panicked—what if she wanted to make me her brother? Still, I replied, trying to stay calm. She asked how I was; I said I was fine and asked about her. She said she was fine too and asked about my Raksha Bandhan plans. I told her I don't really celebrate it because of some family issues. And honestly, I silently thanked God that day—she didn't call me brother or say anything related to tying a rakhi. That small moment felt like a blessing, one I'd never forget.</p>

                    <p>But fate wasn't done with its twists. Tanisha soon started talking to a senior named Amay—and this time, it became serious. They were together. It shattered me completely. I distanced myself from everything, focusing only on my studies as we reached the final exams of class 11.</p>

                    <p>Months later, I heard they had broken up. A strange hope returned to me. I began talking to her again, noticing small hints that she still cared, though neither of us ever said it aloud.</p>

                    <p>When class 12 began, our batch had only fifteen students left—just three boys: me, Dasmat, and Chaitan. We called ourselves the "Three Pillars of the Class." After the retests, Shiv and Rohan rejoined, and life started feeling normal again.</p>

                    <p>I knew she wasn't mine, and maybe never would be. So I tried to let go. I stopped messaging her, and she didn't reach out either.</p>

                    <p>Then one day, while I was watching my friends play basketball, they teased me, saying, "If you make this shot, Tanisha will be all yours." I laughed—but when I threw the ball, it swished cleanly through the hoop. My first-ever basket. Everyone shouted, and for a moment, I wondered—was that a sign from God?</p>

                    <p>Later, as exams approached, I wasn't studying much. Instead, I made a deal with myself: I'll study until she texts me. The moment I started the timer, my phone buzzed. A message—"Hey." From Tanisha.</p>

                    <p>I just sat there, stunned, smiling to myself. Maybe, just maybe, it really was a sign.</p>

                    <div class="quote">
                        "God is still writing your story. Quit trying to steal the pen. Trust the author."
                    </div>

                    <p>Maybe God was writing mine too.</p>

                    <p>Even though I made mistakes—ignoring her, pretending not to care, breaking my own heart—the story didn't end there. Every silence, every message, every accidental glance… all of it was still part of something bigger.</p>

                    <p>I talked with her again, and for a few days, things felt like they were finally falling into place. But somehow, I started doing the same mistake all over again — ignoring her messages. She used to text me first every day, yet I never once texted her first. I don’t even know why I did that. Maybe ego, maybe fear. Looking back now, I can only call it what it was — a stupid mistake.</p>

                    <p>After more than a month of this, she stopped texting me altogether. We even stopped talking in class. The silence between us grew heavy, like a wall neither of us could climb.</p>

                    <p>It stayed that way until the day of our half-yearly exam results. Our Physics teacher, B.K. Paul Sir, was checking our answer sheets in class. I was quietly watching how others had written their papers, curious to see where I stood. Then came the turn for Tanisha’s paper.</p>
                    
                    <p>When she noticed me glancing, she told me — in a friendly but serious tone — not to look. But curiosity got the better of me. I couldn’t help but glance again, and I noticed she had scored low marks. She was already upset, and by looking at her paper, I made things worse. I hadn’t meant to, but it still hurt her.</p>

                    <p>Later, Rohan came to me and said, “Bro, what were you doing? You really made her feel bad. Can’t you see how upset she was when you were looking at her paper? It’s like you cut your own line.” His words hit hard. That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept replaying everything in my head — the look on her face, the guilt eating me alive.</p>

                    <p>I opened Instagram, typed a simple “Hey,” wanting to say sorry… but I couldn’t bring myself to bring up the topic. I didn’t want to remind her of what happened or ruin her night. So I deleted the message.</p>

                    <p>The next day, I planned to say sorry in person. But she wasn’t at school. Two days later, while I was waiting in the corridor, I saw Angi, Rohan, Tanisha, and Anushka walking together. Anushka made some gesture with her eyes, and when I looked in that direction, Angi thought I was staring at Tanisha. She told Tanisha that I was looking at her and even said that I might be in love with her.</p>

                    <p>Tanisha already knew somewhere deep down that I had feelings for her. After that moment, I don’t know what changed in her heart — but she stopped talking to me completely.</p>

                    <p>When I later asked Rohan what had happened, he told me everything. I realized there was no chance she’d speak to me again. Still, I found out from Rohan and Angi that Tanisha kept asking them what I said about her. She seemed curious, even though she avoided me. Maybe she still cared a little… or maybe she was just confused, like me.</p>

                    <p>One afternoon, Angi and Tanisha were sitting on the last bench, to my left. They were talking softly, when suddenly Angi looked at me and said, “You should participate in the solo singing competition.” I was confused — then realized Tanisha had told her to say that. I wondered why Tanisha couldn’t just tell me herself.</p>

                    <p>Out of nervousness or pride, I replied, “Why should I sing?”
That was my mistake again — one of those small, stupid replies that carry big regrets later.</p>

                    <p>Even Rohan told me, “Bro, why are you breaking her heart like this? You talk nicely to everyone… except her.”</p>

                    <p>And honestly, I had no answer. I didn’t know why I behaved that way — cold on the outside when all I wanted was to be close to her.</p>
